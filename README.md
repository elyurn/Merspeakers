# Merspeakers

Merspeakers is a student project created in one month for the HUG: Geneva University Hospitals.

It is a software made to control 4 speakers in parallel with "Focusrite Control", a proprietary software. 
It allows us to __add plenty of sounds in the folder *sounds* which will be displayed, organised, and played in the app__. 
The user can control the level and the balance of each sound.

You can see a report in french on the project, and its usage in the hospitals, in the *README*'s folder.
